"..the ubiquitous Qfwfq, is emblematic of unity amidst the heteroglossic variety
of possibilities offered by expanded degrees of perception made possible by
scientific devices. In one story, Qfwfq is a dinosaur, but in other stories he
is also a fish, a small mammal, a subatomic particle eternally plummeting
through the void. Qfwfq's constantly shifting position in the universe, despite
his consistent first-person narration, suggests the extent to which his form
accommodates his point of view."
